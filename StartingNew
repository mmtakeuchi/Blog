Starting New

I was never one to think too hard about what my future entailed until I actually finished college. I didn’t study very or even think about what I wanted to do for my career when I graduated. After working my first job for a couple years, I slowly started to think about my future and if I was satisfied about what I was currently doing and if this was the right career path for myself. This is when I started looking at other careers, where I eventually read about software engineering and was instantly hooked.

The thought about creating my own projects and apps was very intriguing for me. Being able to work on new hobbies outside of the day-to-day work grind. Understanding that I would feel life I constantly solving puzzles and constantly learning as languages progress, was one of the biggest attractions for me in programming. I love trying to solve puzzles and learning about random things just for the fun of it. Finally, speaking with friends in the industry, they all raved about their jobs. They spoke about the how they actually enjoyed working every day, and that it wasn’t just a mundane job, but a fulfilling career. And this was the turning point in committing to starting fresh learning about becoming a software engineer.
